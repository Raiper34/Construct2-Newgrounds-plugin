# Construct2-Newgrounds-plugin

How to add this to your HTML5 game:
----------------------------------
1. Create a new Newgrounds Game Project  
And in Construct: 
1. Start API (it tooks usually sec, and plugin does not return anything, so you need to wait) 
2. Unlockmedal.

Do not minify script!
---------------------

There is only 2 actions in this plugin, but if API on newgrounds will be updated, I update it too ;)

Used this html5 API, thanks for it: http://www.newgrounds.com/projects/games/646548/preview
